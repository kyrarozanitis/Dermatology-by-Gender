# Gender Demographics in Dermatology (2013-2021)

"Dermatology by Gender" is an analysis of the change in gender demographics from 2013 to 2021 amongst U.S. Medicare dermatologists using data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Medicine, in general, was historically a male-dominated field up until the last few decades. The percentage of female physicians has been on the rise amongst physicians in general as well as amongst dermatologists. 

The figures generated in this project visualize the change in distribution of male and female physicians over the last nine years and represent the variation in physician gender by geographical location to form a better idea of the shifting landscape of physician demographics in the field of dermatology.
